**COMPUTER NETWORKING AND ARCHITECTURE**
internet ->collection of newtorks
rules that are set are called protocols
www->project that stored the documents :hosted by web servers
but it could not be used to search for things 
the internet society dicides a set of rules for different applications to connect with each other
request and response 
protocols are the rules:
TCP:Transmission control protocol this assists the movement of info and data from one place to another
UDP: this is the protocol where not all the info is required to be sent such as video conferencing(user datagram protocol)
HTTP: HYPER TEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL(format of the data that is sent )
The different calls are the packets of data 
Every device that is taking part in internet has an IP addresss
format : X.X.X.X
each X has a range of 0 to 255
how to check your ip address: 
command: curl if config.me -s(type this in the bash)
DHCP:Dynamic host configuration protocol
the modem at our homes has a global ip address ,all the devices connected to this modem has the same ip address 
the modem provides each connected device a local ip address
NAT=>newtork access translator
to decide which application requested the address ,it is found through port
PORTS are 16 bit numbers
total port nos possible =2^16
http : port 80
mongodb : port : 27017(my be wrong)
0-1023 are reserved ports
1024 -49152 :reserved for applications
1mbps=one mega bits per second
LAN:Local area newtork
WAN: wide area network(countries)
1.SONET: it can cover larger distances since it is made up of optical fibre
2.frame relay: it is a way to connet the LAN to WAN
MAN,
modem: convert digital signal to analog signal
router: routes the packet on the basis of ip address
TOPOLOGIES:
1.Bus: 
o--o-----o-------o-------
      |         |  
2.Ring 
3.Star
4.tree: bus+Star
5.Mesh :every single ccomp is connected to each other ccomp in the newtork
----------------------------
STRUCTURE OF NETWORKING
application layer: the first layer that is used to interact
open systems interconnection model : OSI model
it has layers : (7)
1.application layer:
implemented int : software 
2.presentation layer: converts numbs and all to machine understandable format EBCDIC(called translation :encoding ,encription) it also provides abstraction ,date is also compressed ,ssl protocol is used
3.sesion : authentication ,session layer assumes that the layers below it will do their work
4. Transport: transports the data :3 ways: segmentation ,flow control:the amount of data being transported ,check sum tcp,udp
5. newtork : transportation in the laptops in different newtorks funciton of network layer : logical addressing
6.data link : it allows to communicate with the computers #mac address
7.Physical :this is the hardware ,it works with wires 
------------------------------
Another model: TCP/IP model(more into practice )
the internet protocol suit
1. application layer
2.Transport layer
3.network layer
4.data link layer
5.Physical layer
---------------------------
application layer:
users interact with this,it lies on the devices ,protocols , client-server ARCHITECTURE
p2p ARCHITECTURE : the servers are connected to each other
PROTOCOLS:
1.HTTP
2.DHCPSMTP
