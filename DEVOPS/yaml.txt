it is data format used to exchange data
similar to xml and json
int yaml we can only store data
DATA Serialisation
obj to file :Serialisation
and file to obj :deSerialisation
parsing is easy:parsing means reading the data
it has key value pairs
yaml is case sensitive 
indentation is important
----------------------------------
DOCKER
=>Docker makes use of containers
their is need of only one operating system 
however virtual machine needs different operating systems
wsl
1)docker runtime:allows us to start and stop containers (runc and containerd)
2)docker engine
3)orchestration
dockerfile->image->container

Kubernetes
=>immutability
orchetrators : are helping in deploying and managing containers dynamically
1.run it on your own cloud
1)k8s cluster :control plane +nodes
nodes is a server 
and the control plane is the one that manages the nodes
contol plane was earlier named as master node 
cube cutter(kube ctl) is the one where we interact with the control plane 
declarative way is better as it envolves using files to interact instead of writing comands again and again
worker node ->container run time ->pod ->container
pod is a scheduling unit 
-----------------
steps to run any microservice in Kubernetes
1)create microservice
2)containerize it 
3)put container in pods
4)deploy the pods to controllers
CONTROL PLANE 
Control manager : DS,cs 
scheduler : it schedules things
APIserver
--------------------
Architecture of worker node : 
1)kube proxy:required for networking :provides ip address to nodes 
2)kubelet :  required for connecting to the api server 
3) container runtime
